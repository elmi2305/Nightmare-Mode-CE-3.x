# Nightmare Mode Addon
Nightmare Mode is an addon for Better Than Wolves CE 3.X which aims to make the mod a lot harder.

Nightmare Mode features unique mob variants, reworked boss fights, a custom progression post-dragon, 100+ unique achievements, ETC... All information can be found on the newest rendition of the NM Changelog, which is posted in every github release.

The goal of Nightmare Mode is to be the hard mod you were promised in Youtube thumbnails / titles. This means completely unforgiving mechanics, where one mistake can lead to certain death, even hundreds of hours into the playthrough. Mobs are made a LOT stronger. Here are some note-worthy changes:
- Creepers jump towards the player before exploding
- Zombies have increased reach
- Squids shoot their tentacles through walls and teleport the player
- Witches are faster and can throw ender pearls, making escape impossible
- Reworked Nether, reworked End, reworked both Boss fights
- Blood Moons: every 2nd full moon after activating the nether is a Blood Moon, where mobs are buffed and can spawn on any block
- Dynamic difficulty: Mobs increase their stats as you progress. This is split into 4 categories: Pre-Hardmode (pre-nether), Hardmode (post-nether), Post-Wither, and Post-Dragon
- Quality of life features to reduce tech and farming tedium, putting difficulty in the front spot
The full changelog is a lengthy read, and it is recommended that you read it before playing.

Nightmare Mode has a Discord server: https://discord.gg/3Ws8bCp3T6
The server is an active community where open development and suggestions are welcome. Above all, the goal is to have fun playing NM and hanging out.

## Inspirations / Help
The idea of Nightmare Mode was inspired by a few things:
- Terraria
- BTW CE 2.1.4 Mob Enhancements Addon (aka. MEA) by Pot_Tx
- BTW CE 3.0.0 Hostile Difficulty by Arminias
- Various other difficulty mods, including but not limited to PvZ mods, Terraria mods, Kaizo mods, self imposed challenge runs, etc.
Massive thanks to all of these sources of inspiration. Without them, Nightmare Mode would not have the breadth of features it currently has.
